>  What is important to know about you as an engineer?
  * I don't believe in 'move fast and break things'. Much of my experience has been in healthcare related industries and I have a serious commitment to producing software, and CI/CD solutions, that are solid. Not the latest fad of the programming world's day, just to 'make work' for bored engineers. That being said, I am always open to the best or newest solution. Make your case, and if it is better than mine, I'll help you implement it.

> What sparked your interest in programming? Why did you decide to pursue this as your profession?
  * I built computers with my Dad as a kid, so he could give me a platform to program in BASIC. Then C.
  * My first 'job' was as an intern for Mindwave Software, a subsidiary of HNC Software, when I was 14. So technically I've been at this job 20 years.
  * I am a good systems engineer. Cars. Cooking. A water heater... It is all just systems. Programming, then systems, then operations, then DevOps just made sense to me.

> What are some general guiding principles/values that you follow? Why?
  * You cook it until it is done. (Old French cooking adage.)
  * The project is bigger than you think. You have an idea for implementation, and you just want to start coding. Don't. Document every command you type. Design tests around the requirements first. Setup your entire environment first. This isn't cowboy coding, this is enterprise.

> What would you say you’re best at with programming? Why?
  * The big picture. We've all worked with 10 different languages, or DSLs, or scripting languages, or yaml/xml/json, et al. I want to see how all the pieces fit together.

> What are areas you’d like to improve in? Why?
  * Technical documentation. Everybody hates it, but I like it. My issue is my use of language/grammar. (Third person voice.) I don't like what I write - it is never as impressive as Hashicorp docs., etc.

> What problems/challenges do you like solving?
  * The weird ones. The ancient ones. Code nobody has maintained in 10 years, and none of the newer crowd wants to touch it. That's fun.

> What environment do you thrive in?
  * A "results only work environment." If my people attend scheduled meetings and standups, and deliver the work on time and as promised, I really don't care how they do it. Need to take your child to the Doctor? No problem. Car problems? No problem. Did you check in your work, documentation, update your tickets, and keep your team apprised? We're good.

> What is your preferred way of interacting with the team?
  * I have worked remotely for the majority of my career. You have to be twice as available, all the time. I prefer video so I can see people, I am not as good on the phone. Slack, good documentation, keeping up on what you are doing.

> What are other components about you as a programmer/engineer that are worth highlighting?
  * I fix things. It's what I'm good at. In life or in tech. Give me an opportunity and a little time and I'll solve it. And, if I can't, I will raise my hand and ask for the best options in the room. The Picard philosophy.
